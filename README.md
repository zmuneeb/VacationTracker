# Vacation Tracker Mobile Application

## Vacation Tracker Application
 - The purpose of the application is to allow users to add vacations and excursions associated with their vacations.
 - The vacation contains information like location, place of stay, dates, and excursions associated with it.
 - The user can view and share the vacations that they create.

## How to operate the app
 - Once the user opens the app, they will be introduced to the login page. For new users, they will create "Sign up" and create an account.
 - Once they create an account and log in, they will be welcomed on the homepage. They have two options, view their vacations or view their excursions.
 - If they click on the vacations, they will land on the Vacations page. Currently it will be empty if this is the user's first time, so they will have to click the button that says "Add Vacation".
 - The "Add Vacation" page allows the user to add information for their vacation.
 - Similarly, the Excursions page behaves in the same fashion.
 - After a user has created an excursion, they can add this excursion to a vacation in the "Add Vacation" page.
 - Options will be shown under each created vacation or excursion.
 - For vacations, options shown are View, Update, Share, and Delete.
  - The View button will take the user to a page that shows all information about the vacation.
  - The Update button allows the user to change information about the vacation. 
  - The Share button allows the user to share the vacation via text, email, etc.
  - The Delete button allows the user to delete the vacation.
 - For excursions, there are two buttons: View/Update, and Delete.
  - The View/Update is the same as the "Add Excursion" page, since the information for excursions is just two fields, it can be used to view the excursion information as well.
  - The Delete button will delete the excursion.

## Android Version
 - The minimum SDK version for the app is 26, or Android 8.0.
